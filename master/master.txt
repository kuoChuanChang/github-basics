1. add repository in github(include settings)
2. save the same name to github repostory in local dictionary. 

----
â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line
git remote add origin git@github.com:charliech17/github-basics.git (orgin: is shorten of your url. need to be consist)
git branch -M main (option)
git push (-u) origin main ("orgin" is the shorten of url. need to be consist. "main" is the brach name you want to create)

---
situation: remote branch has some changes.
1. git fetch [shorten url]
2. git branch -a (this will show up  remote branch)

or use:
1. git pull [shorten url (ex: orgin)] [branch you want to merge to]

use "git checkout [remote branch name] " to go to detach head mode. Then:
3. git checkout -b [new branch name] (to create new branch to your local files)

---there is a better way to do this.
***here
1. git branch --track [new branch name(need to equal to remote branch)] [shorten url (ex: orgin)]/[remote branch name]
2. git push
